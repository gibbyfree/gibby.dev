      <description>Reprise is a product-led growth platform that specializes in the creation of demos and product tours. Using Reprise&amp;rsquo;s browser extension, a user is able to capture their website or web application. This capture is parsed by the extension, and the user can use Reprise&amp;rsquo;s editor to directly modify the behavior and appearance of their demo. This no-code editor enables always-on, infrastructure-less views into the user&amp;rsquo;s application or webpage, allowing companies to create demos for their products without having to go through the trouble of configuring, enabling, and maintaining a fickle demo environment.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Reprise is a product-led growth platform that specializes in the creation of demos and product tours. Using Reprise&amp;rsquo;s browser extension, a user is able to capture their website or web application. This capture is parsed by the extension, and the user can use Reprise&amp;rsquo;s editor to directly modify the behavior and appearance of their demo. This no-code editor enables always-on, infrastructure-less views into the user&amp;rsquo;s application or webpage, allowing companies to create demos for their products without having to go through the trouble of configuring, enabling, and maintaining a fickle demo environment. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have on my resume to represent my time at Reprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented full-stack features in Repriseâ€™s no-code editing platform and browser
extension using TypeScript, Vue.js, and Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigated experimental approaches to improve reliability and performance of a tool that
clones modern web applications and intercepts web requests to mock backend services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported efforts to integrate analytics pipelines with external services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprise is the smallest and most dynamic company that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked at. Broadly speaking, my work at Reprise involved improving the usability, performance, and functionality of our products. This includes Reprise&amp;rsquo;s Screen Capture offering, as well as their experimental Live Demo product, which allows users to capture sandboxed versions of complex web applications. I also spent time on the Chromium extension team, as well as the analytics team. It was an awesome and unique experience to work across the entire product&amp;rsquo;s platform during my time at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the unique problems (and innovative solutions) that I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to while working at Reprise. The tech stack consists of a Vue.js / TypeScript frontend, and a Django backend. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved working with these technologies on my own personal time, and it was wonderful to be able to work with them professionally. In addition, this was my first role where I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much hands-on work with browser extensions. The use of the extension, along with the cutting-edge nature of our browser-based no-code editor, has led me to learn a lot about the inner workings of web browsers. I was challenged by the nuances of this kind of &amp;ldquo;low-level&amp;rdquo; web development, especially as I worked through highly ambiguous tasks and played around with experimental approaches to improve the reliability of Reprise&amp;rsquo;s product offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time at Reprise was a whirlwind of learning and implementation, and I feel like I grew a lot from a role where individual contributors could leave such a lasting impact on the application. In addition, I found that flexibility and agility were important qualities to have if one wishes to thrive in an early-stage startup. It was a great opportunity to be able to improve on those competencies at this position.&lt;/p&gt;
