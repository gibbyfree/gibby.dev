**Greetings, friend!** My name is Gibby [gÉª.bi:] and I'm a Software Engineer at Reprise. I am most invigorated by backend development, programming languages, natural language processing, and systems architecture.

Outside of computing, I also enjoy spoken languages, small keyboards, cooking, narrative nonfiction, puzzles, the great outdoors, and just about anything else that sets off electrical impulses in my brain. Welcome to my funny little corner of the World Wide Web :-)
