**Greetings!** My name is Gibby [gɪb.i:] and I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I am most invigorated by programming languages, compilers, and systems programming. I'm currently based in Seattle.

Outside of computing, I also enjoy spoken languages, small keyboards, cooking, narrative nonfiction, puzzles, the great outdoors, and just about anything else that sets off electrical impulses in my brain. Here, I write about many of those things.
