## Overview
I've always enjoyed participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), even if I never end up finishing the whole thing. The event comes at a bad time for me, where finals exams, co-op interviews, and holidays intersect in such a way that it's impossible to commit to hours of extracurricular coding each week. However, I like to use AoC as an excuse to play around with a language that I wouldn't otherwise put my hands on. This year, I chose to experiment with **Nim**. I hadn't heard of Nim until a friend mentioned it to me shortly prior to AoC. The tl;dr on Nim is that it's statically typed and compiles to JavaScript and the C family. I have described it as being the illegitimate child of Python and TypeScript, which are two of my favorite languages to use. Here are some of the most enjoyable + quirky aspects of Nim that I uncovered as I worked through Advent of Code in 2021:

(It's unfortunate that my Hugo theme doesn't support syntax highlighting for Nim... Just imagine it in your mind :slightly_smiling_face:!)

### Day 1
I had no clue what I was doing with Nim when I started [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1). I was just using it as I'd use Python, and praying that nothing would blow up.

{{< code language="nim" title="nim result is cool!" id="1" isCollapsed="false" >}}
proc findIncreases(nums: seq[int]): int =
    for i in 1 .. nums.len - 1:
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
            result += 1
{{< /code >}}

I really liked the idea of this `result` variable, which is a shorthand for declaring and returning some kind of output variable. Nim automagically returns the value of `result` once your `proc` finishes executing. Coolio!

### Day 2
[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) was a more challenging problem, and required me to use some of the more complex features of Nim. As a statically typed language enjoyer, I started to dabble in Nim typing. I really liked their synatx for initializing typed variables. I also really liked tuples:

{{< code language="nim" title="tuples and variables" id="2" isCollapsed="false" >}}
proc getFinalPosition(commands: seq[tuple[direction: string, x:int]]): tuple[horizontal: int, depth: int] =
    var 
        hz: int
        depth: int
{{< /code >}}

I think that I used tuples appropriate for this method, but throughout AoC, I may have overused them. They're a nifty data structure, but I tended to use tuples as a way of overcomplicating methods. This would lead to a devastating refactor if Part 2 of a problem conflicted with my initial division of labor in my procs.

### Day 4
[This](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) is when things started to get bad, you guys. Day 4 is around the time when I began to feel frustrated with Nim -- or rather, my inability to conform my problem-solving to its limitations. I brute-forced the thing, but still wrote a few enjoyable one-liners. 

For instance: `strNums.keepItIf(it != "") # remove blank lines` Although I would become frustrated with the absence of certain utils in `sequtils`, I really like `keepItIf`. 

By Day 4, I also had developed a stubborn attachment for explicitly typing as much as I could. This works out pretty well until you start dealing with 3D arrays. (To be fair, you would have this same issue with Java... I think the concise nature of `seq` just makes it harder to look at than `ArrayList<ArrayList<ArrayList>>`) This is not enjoyable to write or maintain:

{{< code language="nim" title="seqs on the beach" id="3" isCollapsed="false" >}}
proc boardLoop(commands: seq[int], boards: seq[seq[seq[int]]]): int =
    var currBoards: seq[seq[seq[int]]] = boards
    for s in commands:
        var checkedBoards: seq[seq[seq[int]]] = checkBoards(s, currBoards)
{{< /code >}}

If it weren't for finals week, I would have been motivated to figure out this puzzle:

{{< code language="nim" title="2d seq transpose" id="3" isCollapsed="false" >}}
proc transpose(s: seq[seq[int]]): seq[seq[int]] = # don't care to figure out how to do this with map()
  result = newSeq[seq[int]](s[0].len)
  for i in 0 .. s[0].high:
    result[i] = newSeq[int](s.len)
    for j in 0 .. s.high:
      result[i][j] = s[j][i]
{{< /code >}}

This is what I wrote to transpose a bingo board, or flip the board such that rows became columns and columns became rows. This problem isn't even Nim-related, moreso related to my lack of experience in functional programming. If I were solving this in Python, I could've used something like numpy or even `zip()` to transpose the 2D-array. With Nim, you gotta bake that from scratch!
