# Why blog?
I'm a firm believer in the Internet's power to serve as a repository of information and expertise. 
I write here because I love to share my learnings with others, and because I believe that information should be accessible to everyone. 
I grew up with limited resources, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without access to content like this.
