I'm a firm believer in the Internet's power to serve as a repository of information and expertise, and for various reasons I believe that **text** is the ideal medium to capture, convey, and archive knowledge effectively.

Basically, I write here because I love sharing my learnings with others. Information should be accessible to everyone. Access to free, high-quality educational content in computing enables individuals from all backgrounds to excel in engineering and related fields. I grew up with limited resources, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without access to content like this. 
# Technical experience
I've been a Software Engineer at Microsoft since 2022. My background also includes working in full-stack web development, platform engineering, and test automation. I studied journalism in college, so I also have some experience in data analysis and visualization.

My preferred programming languages include Rust, TypeScript, C# ...

Ummm...
