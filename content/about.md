I'm a firm believer in the Internet's power to serve as a repository of information and expertise. I write here because I love to share my learnings with others, and because I believe that information should be accessible to everyone. I grew up with limited resources, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without access to content like this. 

## Credentials
I've been a Software Engineer at Microsoft since 2022. I have some other professional experience in full-stack web development, platform engineering, test automation, data analysis, and data visualization.

My preferred programming languages include Rust, TypeScript, C#... umm...
