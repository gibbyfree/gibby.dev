It's an honor and a privilege to be able to work at a company with such a rich history in the world of computing. I have only been with Microsoft for a short time, so I'm at pains to introduce a friend I've barely met :slightly_smiling_face: Currently, I live within Engineering Systems at Microsoft. My day-to-day work strives to improve the developer experience at Microsoft, which in turn improves the quality of what is ultimately delivered to Microsoft's gargantuan customer base. I'm driven to learn all that I can from my brilliant teammates, and from the general aura of brilliance that can be found in Microsoft's engineering organization.
