Over a year ago, my partner and I visited Bellingham, WA to shop for antiques. We went to Penny Lane Antique Mall first, since it was the most (Google) reviewed antique shop in the city. There was another antique shop next door, called Aladdin's Antiques and Records. Although we didn't plan to visit Aladdin's, it was nearby so we went inside. As its name suggests, among other standard antique shop fare, Aladdin's sold musical antiques - records and record players, accordions, sound systems, and antique instruments. 

Long story short, that afternoon I found myself fixated on a pile of zithers.

# What is a zither?
A zither is basically a stringed instrument where strings are stretched over a thin, flat body without extending past the body's sounding box. Think of an acoustic guitar or a cello - these instruments are **not** zithers because their strings span the entire body of the instrument, past the sounding box. (Plus, neither instrument is thin, nor flat.)

There are several categories of zithers, so if this sounds interesting to you, the zither wikipedia page is great reading. (I think tube zithers are particularly cool.) To most, the prototypical zither looks like this:

{}

To my untrained eye, this looks like a tiny harp with two sets of strings and a fretboard. This would be called a concert zither, and this type of zither is more popular in eastern Europe. In North America, chord zithers are more commonly found. I unearthed several chord zithers in Bellingham.

## Chord zithers
Put simply, chord zithers make it easier to play chords. To me, a chord zither is distinguished by some special set of strings (or some special set of buttons) that are used to play *chords* instead of *notes*. The autoharp is a very well-known chord zither - if you're into 60s pop, *Do You Believe in Magic* by The Lovin' Spoonful features the autoharp. The instrument certainly had its 'moment' in the 60s.

Hidden beneath the autoharp's "plate" of buttons, there are several bars affixed with soft pads. When an autoharp's chord button is pressed, the bar is lowered onto the strings and pads will mute all strings *except for* the strings needed to produce a given chord. 

In the 80s, Suzuki released the Omnichord, which is an electronic/synthesized version of an autoharp. Omnichords offer the same "button chording" functionality as the autoharp, but the two instruments sound *very* different. I only mention the omnichord because I think it sounds really, really cool. 

I've been looking for a new instrument to learn, so I introduced myself to the world of chord zithers when I got home from Bellingham. As I watched various Youtube videos and scraped the autoharp subreddit, I could see myself playing around with an autoharp, but I was missing a certain 'wow' factor. I continued exploring the zither family and eventually ran across the tremoloa.
# Tremoloa
The tremoloa is a fascinating instrument. The body of the tremoloa is dominated by a steel arm which supports a weighted rolling bar. The "melody string" running along the bottom of the instrument can be picked using a plectrum at the end of the arm. When the melody string is picked, the string vibrates against the weighted bar, which produces this ghostly, janky sound. Using the strings that run along the top of the instruments, accompanying notes/chords can be played with the left hand.

If the autoharp is niche, then the tremoloa is on another level of niche. This is a fretless instrument - these markings near the strings may seem fret-like, but from what I understand, they're not very helpful when playing. I was disappointed to learn that tremoloa is so difficult to learn, because I'd found my 'wow' factor in this barred stringed zither. 

In my research, I found that the tremoloa was created as an attempt to market **Hawaiian steel guitar** to American consumers. (Though obviously, this instrument sounds nothing like Hawaiian steel guitar. Maybe call it a failed attempt?)
# What is steel guitar?
I've always been confused by this phrase 'steel guitar'. In the past, I've played classical guitar - acoustic guitar, where the steel strings are replaced with softer nylon ones. So I wondered, is 'steel guitar' just... regular guitar?

Steel guitar specifically refers to guitar that's played with a bar (or some other object) pressed against its strings. I grew up listening to blues, so I'm familiar with this image of a crazy-looking guitar played with a metal tube on a finger of the fretting hand. This tube is pressed and slid along the fretboard, bringing a distinctly twangy timbre to notes picked with the other hand. Folks often refer to this style of steel guitar as "slide guitar".

This form of steel guitar is usually played upright, meaning the body of the instrument is held against the body, strings facing outward. **Hawaiian steel guitar** is typically played with the guitar laid across the player's lap, with one hand controlling the bar along the fretboard and another hand picking strings. As a more comfortable playing position, 

This playing style gave rise to **lap steel guitar**.

# What makes pedal steel so special?

# The trouble with learning pedal steel
Relative to something like piano or clarinet, the pedal steel is an obscure instrument. Student models are expensive ($1000+). All models are heavy (50+ lbs). Variation between models makes it difficult to provide "one sizes fits all" instruction - are you trying to learn C6 tuning without any knee levers, or E9 tuning with 12 foot pedals and 8 knee levers? 

I've spoken with experienced pedal steel players who refer to the instrument as a "theory machine".
