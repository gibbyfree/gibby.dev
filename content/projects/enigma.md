In late 2020, I stumbled upon a *The Code Book* written by Simon Singh. I was intrigued by the book's discussion of cryptographic history, especially its coverage of the earliest forms of cryptography. *The Code Book* spends a fair bit of time talking about the Enigma Machine, which was a legendary cipher machine used by the Axis powers during World War II. I was aware of the Enigma Machine before reading *The Code Book*, but I didn't possess any prior knowledge as to how it worked.
